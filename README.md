# irssi-sb_separator
A simple script to add up to three individually configured separators in irssi statusbars. 

The separators can be configured in theme-file with the following variables: 

- sb_separator = "-";
- sb_separator_2 = "|";
- sb_separator_3 = ":";

Color codes are obviously supported. The script provides three items to be placed in statusbar windows: 

- separator
- separator_2
- separator_3
